Math Runner is an enjoyable game for learning math for children.

##  Our Goal

Our goal was to create a fun learning game for kids, without giving them the feeling they learn by allowing the player to play with fun atmosphere that does not resemble other educational games where you have to type the correct answer or drag it to the correct place, but everything Made while playing and moving, avoiding obstacles and more.

In fact, the game provides the tools for children to learn basic mathematical activities such as: connecting, subtracting, multiplying and dividing.

##  About Game

We created an infinite runner game that collects numbers and math signs that appears randomly on the road such that the player must collects the items in the right order, .For winning the game he needs to achive the target sum and then collect the equal sign.

We have created a variety of game maps that allow the player to choose from a number of different environments which will make the child want to play more in the game, as a result he will continue to improve and even enjoy it.
In each map we offer several different levels of education that suit different ages and grades. Thus, the child will want to learn and improve so that he can progress to the next levels.

In addition, it is important to note that the game can suit all ages as it is challenging and demonstrates the ability to react quickly.
